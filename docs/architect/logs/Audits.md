## View all logs
We captures and organizes authentication events into a table. It keeps track of the event name, user, application, and timestamp. You can narrow down the results by filtering based on the event name and application name. Filtering on a specific event will provide additional details.

## Perform a detailed analysis
Administrators can perform a detailed analysis of logs associated with specific users, facilitating comprehensive investigations into specific events. The navigation process is straightforward and user-friendly.

To access user-specific logs, follow these steps: Navigate to User Management, select the desired user, and click on User Logs. The resulting table will exclusively display log events performed and triggered by that particular user.
