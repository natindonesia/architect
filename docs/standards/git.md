# Git Best Practices

This document outlines industry-standard best practices for using Git, a distributed version control system widely used for software development. Following these guidelines will help ensure your codebase remains clean, maintainable, and collaborative.

## Branching Strategy

### Main Branch

- The `main` (or `master`) branch should always be in a deployable state.
- Direct commits to `main` should be avoided; all changes should come through pull requests.
- Use branch protection rules to enforce this policy.

### Feature Branches

- Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix.
- Use descriptive names for feature branches (e.g., `feature/add-login`, `bugfix/fix-authentication`).
- Regularly rebase feature branches against `main` to keep them up-to-date.

### Release Branches

- Use release branches to prepare for a new production release.
- Name release branches using the release version (e.g., `release/1.0.0`).
- Perform final testing on the release branch before merging into `main`.

### Hotfix Branches

- Hotfix branches are used to quickly patch production issues.
- Name hotfix branches with the issue or bug number (e.g., `hotfix/issue-123`).
- After the hotfix is applied, merge the branch into both `main` and the current release branch.

## Commit Messages

### Commit Message Format

- Use a standard format for commit messages:
    ```
    <type>(<scope>): <subject>
    
    <body>
    
    <footer>
    ```
- The `<type>` can be `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, or `chore`.
Example:
    ```
    feat(auth): add login functionality
    
    - Added login form
    - Implemented authentication logic
    
    Closes #123
    ```

### Imperative Mood

- Write commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
- This style aligns with automated tools that use commit messages to generate changelogs.

### Atomic Commits

- Make each commit a logical unit of work.
- Avoid committing unrelated changes in a single commit.

## Pull Requests

### Small and Focused

- Keep pull requests small and focused on a single change or feature.
- This makes them easier to review and understand.

### Description and Context

- Provide a clear description and context for the changes in the pull request.
- Include screenshots, if applicable, to demonstrate UI changes.

### Code Reviews

- Ensure all pull requests undergo code review before merging.
- Use the review process to maintain code quality and share knowledge within the team.

## Code Quality

### Linting and Formatting

- Use linting tools to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues.
- Format code consistently using tools like Prettier or Black.

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure the test suite passes before merging changes into `main`.

## Documentation

### README.md

- Maintain an up-to-date `README.md` file at the root of the repository.
- Include setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

### Code Comments

- Use comments to explain complex or non-obvious code.
- Avoid redundant comments that state the obvious.

## Automation

### Continuous Integration

- Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) system to automatically run tests and checks on each pull request.
- Common CI tools include GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Travis CI.

### Continuous Deployment

- Implement Continuous Deployment (CD) to automatically deploy changes to production.
- Ensure deployments are tested and reliable before enabling automatic deployments.
